cellularAutomation
==================

Provides an interface for playing with elementary cellular automata (see: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html). You can define your own rules and click through the generations or change the board to make interesting patterns.

Installation instructions:
Simply npm install.

After installation, run "grunt serve" to run the application (or "grunt build && grunt connect:dist:keepalive" for a minified version of the site).

If the app doesn't automatically launch in your browser, go to http://localhost:9000 to see it in action.
